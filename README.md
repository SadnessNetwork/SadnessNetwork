# Hi there, I'm Nazar! 👋

I'm a Backend-focused Developer from Ukraine! ✨ I'm a very fast learner in most programming languages and an open-source server app creator; with focus on: [`TypeScript`] (and [`JavaScript`] 👀) & [`Rust`]. I've also experimented with [`Python`] (and [`Java`]), [`C#`] and a bit of [`C++`] 😄

- 😄 Pronouns: anything you want, as long as it isn't offensive to anyone. He, she, they, doesn't matter to me
- ⚡ Fun fact: I learn the fastest by diving head first into a problem / new thing, and if that doesn't work, by researching it. While counter intuitive, this has helped me get started with the world of programming! Nowadays, I do research, but after I tried figuring out the solution by myself 😅
- 👀 I have an interesting relationship with some languages (like [`Rust`]); while I can understand the code and how it works, I am much slower at writing it compared to languages I'm more comfortable with (like [`TypeScript`])

## 📚 Experience

I'm a self taught, backend developer, that went head first into coding and fell in love from the first lines of code I've written! Started experimenting with coding around **June of 2018** in the [`Rust`] programming language. Since **March of 2019**, I switched to JavaScript as my main language, and shortly after moved to [`TypeScript`] (thanks to its much better coding experience), which is what I use daily now. I've also experimented with other languages (such as [`C++`], [`C#`] or [`Python`]), but so far my language of choice is still [`TypeScript`].

### Key Notes ✍️

- Self taught, full stack developer
- Started coding in **2019**
- Over 4 years of experience with **[`JavaScript`]** and over 3 with **[`TypeScript`]**
- Willing to learn new things all the time, and work in teams 😄
